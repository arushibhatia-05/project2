        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>Ski resorts are an extremely popular destination in the U.S and attract millions of visitors. Due to their popularity, there is a wide range of resorts, each that offers different activities and excursions and cost-varying rates per night. Our goal is to analyze different datasets and find a
            correlation between factors that are present in different U.S. ski resorts and how they lead to increased or decreased traffic and tourism at each respective resort. The factors we plan to look into include but are not limited to, geographic location, snowfall levels, terrain difficulty,
            amenities, pricing, and accessibility. Understanding these dynamics is vital not only for tourists seeking the best ski experience but also for resort operators looking to optimize pricing, improve
            infrastructure, and adapt to changing climate conditions. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, this project will provide insights into how ski resorts can enhance their offerings and how skiers can make informed travel decisions based on the key attributes we
            mentioned above.
